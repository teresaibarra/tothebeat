## To The Beat (WIP)

This project beatmatches techno music (generated by [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max)) to heartbeats (captured by a wearable heart rate monitor). 

`serve_hr.py` connects to a heart rate monitor and streams heart rate data over OSC. The Max patch collects that data through OSC to alter a metronome's BPM. 

This project was named after the [Hilary Duff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gua14Z09HR4) song and was created at [Recurse Center](http://recurse.com/) in March 2024.

### Usage

### Using without a heart rate monitor
You don't have to have to use a heart rate monitor to play around with the Max patch. See the following gif:

### Using with a heart rate monitor
In short, run `python3 serve_hr.py`, then run the Max patch.

This script should work with any wearable/Bluetooth Low Energy device that transmits Heart Rate Measurement data. The device originally used to create this script can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CRQW6T18), but a cheaper one should work fine.

o identify the device's name, use a tool such as [Bluetility](https://github.com/jnross/Bluetility). Once identified, replace `DEVICE_NAME` in the `serve_hr.py` script with the correct name."
