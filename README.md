## To The Beat

This project finds a wearable heart rate monitor (Bluetooth Low Energy device) and streams its heart rate data over UDP. The script in the MaxMSP patch listens in on the port to create a metronome that changes depending on the wearer's heart rate.



### Usage
Run `python ble_info.py`, then run the MaxMSP patch.
